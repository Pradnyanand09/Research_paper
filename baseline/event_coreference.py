In case OntoChem {E96 finds} a novel and unexpected antiviral {E97 use} of those {E98 Rejected} {E99 Hit} Compounds during this 2-years period , it will {E100 notify} Anixa about these {E101 findings} and Anixa has the right of first {E102 negotiation} during a period of 6 months after this {E103 notification} . If Anixa {E104 decides} to not {E105 license} those {E106 uses} or compounds for this novel antiviral use, OntoChem is free to {E107 develop} those molecules further as its own intellectual property without any further restrictions. 2.5 Subcontractors. OntoChem may {E108 engage} one or more subcontractors to {E109 perform} its {E110 activities} under the Research Plan with the prior {E111 written} approval of Anixa and {E112 provided} that, with respect to any such subcontractor, OntoChem will (a) be responsible and liable for the {E113 performance} of such subcontractor and (b) {E114 enter} into a {E115 written} agreement (i) consistent with terms and conditions of this Agreement, {E116 including} with respect to confidentiality and intellectual property, and (ii) {E117 prohibiting} such subcontractor from further subcontracting. For clarity, vendors where commercial building blocks or compounds will be {E118 purchased} are nor {E119 regarded} as subcontractors. 2.6 Target Exclusivity. During the term of this Agreement, except in the {E120 performance} of its obligations or {E121 exercise} of its rights under this Agreement, neither OntoChem nor any of its Affiliates will {E122 discover} , {E123 research} , {E124 develop} , {E125 manufacture} or {E126 commercialize} any compound or product {E127 directed} to any Target, either independently or for or in collaboration with a third party ( {E128 including} the grant of a license to any third party), or have any of the foregoing {E129 activities} {E130 performed} on behalf of OntoChem or any of its Affiliates by a third party. For clarity, the foregoing {E131 includes} the {E132 screening} ( {E133 including} via computational methods) of any compound library or virtual compound library against any Target. 2.7 Records. Each Party will {E134 maintain} complete and accurate records of all {E135 activities} {E136 performed} by or on behalf of such Party under the Research Program and all {E137 Inventions} {E138 made} or {E139 generated} by or on behalf of such Party in the {E140 performance} of the Research Program.
