Financial Terms. 3.1 Research Program Payments. In consideration for OntoChem's {E176 performance} of its {E177 activities} under the Research Plan, Anixa will: (a) {E178 pay} OntoChem 100,002 Euros in six (6) equal installments as follows : (i) 16,667 Euros within five (5) days after the Effective Date ; and (ii) five (5) installments in the amount of 16,667 Euros on each one-month anniversary of the Effective Date , except that the last such {E179 payment} will be due within thirty (30) days after {E180 completion} of all {E181 activities} under the Research Plan; and (b) {E182 reimburse} OntoChem for its out-of-pocket expenses {E183 incurred} in {E184 performing} the Research Plan on a pass- through basis without mark-up, within thirty (30) days after {E185 delivery} of an invoice therefore ( {E186 including} reasonable {E187 supporting} documentation), {E188 provided} that Anixa has {E189 approved} such expenses in advance and in writing ( including in regard to the {E190 selection} of specific Hit Compounds to be {E191 synthesized} and {E192 analyzed} in biological assays). It is {E193 estimated} that OntoChem's out-of-pocket expenses under the Research Plan will {E194 include} 110,000 Euros payable to Tube Pharmaceuticals GmbH as a subcontractor of OntoChem, subject to Section 2.5. (c) High-throughput screening compounds OntoChem will forward a commercial {E195 proposal} to {E196 acquire} these compounds at the sole discretion of Anixa. Both parties will {E197 agree} on payment conditions. (d) Extra custom synthesis OntoChem will forward a commercial {E198 proposal} to have {E199 synthesized} these compounds at the sole discretion of Anixa. Both parties will {E200 agree} on payment conditions. (e) Biological testing OntoChem will forward a commercial {E201 proposal} to have biologically {E202 test} these compounds at the sole discretion of Anixa. Both parties will {E203 agree} on payment conditions. 3.2 Lead Scaffold Payments. For each Lead Scaffold {E204 selected} by Anixa, Anixa will {E205 pay} OntoChem an annual fee of 10,000 U.S. Dollars, payable within thirty (30) days following each anniversary of the date of the Selection Notice, until five (5) years after the first commercial {E206 sale} of the first product {E207 incorporating} a compound from such Lead Scaffold, subject to Section 4.3 with respect to any Terminated Scaffold (as {E208 defined} below). 3.3 Milestone Payment. Anixa will {E209 pay} OntoChem a one-time milestone {E210 payment} of 300,000 U.S. Dollars within thirty (30) days following the {E211 dosing} of the first patient in the first human clinical trial for the first product {E212 incorporating} a compound from a Lead Scaffold. 4 3.4 Payment Terms. {E213 Payments} to OntoChem will be {E214 made} by check or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as {E215 designated} in writing by OntoChem from time to time. Taxes (and any penalties and interest thereon) {E216 imposed} on any {E217 payment} {E218 made} by Anixa to OntoChem will be the responsibility of OntoChem. The fees for the respective bank {E219 transfers} will be {E220 borne} by Anixa. 3.5 Financial Records. OntoChem will {E221 maintain} complete and accurate books and accounting records {E222 related} to all out-of-pocket expenses {E223 incurred} in {E224 performing} the Research Plan. These records will be available for {E225 inspection} during regular business hours upon reasonable {E226 notice} by Anixa, or its duly {E227 authorized} representative, at Anixa's expense, for three (3) years following the end of the calendar year in which such expenses are {E228 invoiced} . If it is {E229 determined} that Anixa has {E230 overpaid} for any expenses {E231 passed} through by OntoChem under this Agreement, OntoChem will promptly {E232 reimburse} Anixa for the amount of such {E233 overpayment} and, if such {E234 overpayment} {E235 represents} more than five percent (5%) of the corresponding amount due, OntoChem will {E236 pay} Anixa's reasonable fees and expenses {E237 incurred} in connection with such {E238 inspection} . 4. Term and Termination. 4.1 Term . Unless earlier {E239 terminated} in accordance with Section 4.2 or 4.3, this Agreement will be in effect from the Effective Date until {E240 completion} of the Research Program. 4.2 Termination by Anixa. This Agreement may be {E241 terminated} by Anixa, without cause, upon at least thirty (30) days {E242 written} notice to OntoChem. 4.3 Termination of Lead Scaffolds.", "events": [{"id": "E158",
