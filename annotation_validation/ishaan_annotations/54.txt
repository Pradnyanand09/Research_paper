In addition, Anixa will have the right to reasonably  {E185:function="",head="",partofspeech="" request}  additional information  {E39:function="",head="",partofspeech="" relating}  to such data, and OntoChem will  {E40:function="",head="",partofspeech="" respond}  to such {E185:function="",head="",partofspeech="" requests} promptly with any such additional information in its possession or control,  {E41:function="",head="",partofspeech="" provided}  that, for clarity, OntoChem will not be  {E42:function="",head="",partofspeech="" required}  to  {E43:function="",head="",partofspeech="" perform}  any new or additional {E186:function="",head="",partofspeech="" research} in order to  {E44:function="",head="",partofspeech="" generate}  any such additional information. 2

2.4 Selection of Lead Scaffolds. Within  one year   {E45:function="",head="",partofspeech="" following}  {E187:function="",head="",partofspeech="" completion} of all {E171:function="",head="",partofspeech="" activities} under the Research Plan (the "Selection Deadline"), Anixa, in good faith {E189:function="",head="",partofspeech="" consultation} with OntoChem, will have the right to  {E46:function="",head="",partofspeech="" select}  up to two hundred (200) Hit Compounds (each, a "Selected Hit Compound"), by  {E47:function="",head="",partofspeech="" providing}  OntoChem with written notice of such Selected Hit Compound(s) (the "Selection Notice"), and each  {E190:function="",head="",partofspeech="" Selected}  Hit Compound, along with all Variants of such Selected Hit Compound  {E49:function="",head="",partofspeech="" referenced}  in the Selection Notice, is hereby  {E50:function="",head="",partofspeech="" designated}  as a "Lead Scaffold" under this Agreement.  {E51:function="",head="",partofspeech="" Commencing}  upon {E190:function="",head="",partofspeech="" selection} of a Selected Hit Compound, Anixa (itself and through its Affiliates and designees) will have sole authority over and control of the further {E191:function="",head="",partofspeech="" development}, {E192:function="",head="",partofspeech="" manufacture}, and {E193:function="",head="",partofspeech="" commercialization} of the corresponding Lead Scaffold and any product candidate or product  {E52:function="",head="",partofspeech="" incorporating}  a compound from such Lead Scaffold.  {E53:function="",head="",partofspeech="" Following}  the Selection Deadline, Anixa will have no further rights with respect to any Hit Compound that is not a Selected Hit Compound or  {E54:function="",head="",partofspeech="" included}  within a Lead Scaffold (each, a "Rejected Hit Compound"),  {E55:function="",head="",partofspeech="" provided}  that, during the period of two (2)  years   following  the Selection Deadline, neither OntoChem nor any of its Affiliates will  {E56:function="",head="",partofspeech="" use}  or  {E57:function="",head="",partofspeech="" disclose}  to any third party any Rejected Hit Compound or any Variant thereof,  {E58:function="",head="",partofspeech="" including}  the identity, structure or SAR information of any such compound, for application as anti-viral agents or protease inhibitors, for purposes of  {E59:function="",head="",partofspeech="" modulating}  any Target or for {E194:function="",head="",partofspeech="" treatment} of virus- {E60:function="",head="",partofspeech="" related}  conditions. In case OntoChem  {E242:function="",head="",partofspeech="" finds}  a novel and unexpected antiviral {E195:function="",head="",partofspeech="" use} of those  {E62:function="",head="",partofspeech="" Rejected}   {E63:function="",head="",partofspeech="" Hit}  Compounds during this  2-years period , it will  {E244:function="",head="",partofspeech="" notify}  Anixa about these {E242:function="",head="",partofspeech="" findings} and Anixa has the right of first {E243:function="",head="",partofspeech="" negotiation} during a period of  6 months  after this {E244:function="",head="",partofspeech="" notification}. If Anixa  {E65:function="",head="",partofspeech="" decides}  to not  {E66:function="",head="",partofspeech="" license}  those {E195:function="",head="",partofspeech="" uses} or compounds for this novel antiviral use, OntoChem is free to  {E67:function="",head="",partofspeech="" develop}  those molecules further as its own intellectual property without any further restrictions. 2.5 Subcontractors. OntoChem may  {E68:function="",head="",partofspeech="" engage}  one or more subcontractors to  {E69:function="",head="",partofspeech="" perform}  its {E197:function="",head="",partofspeech="" activities} under the Research Plan with the prior  {E70:function="",head="",partofspeech="" written}  approval of Anixa and  {E71:function="",head="",partofspeech="" provided}  that, with respect to any such subcontractor, OntoChem will (a) be responsible and liable for the {E198:function="",head="",partofspeech="" performance} of such subcontractor and (b)  {E72:function="",head="",partofspeech="" enter}  into a  {E73:function="",head="",partofspeech="" written}  agreement (i) consistent with terms and conditions of this Agreement,  {E74:function="",head="",partofspeech="" including}  with respect to confidentiality and intellectual property, and (ii)  {E75:function="",head="",partofspeech="" prohibiting}  such subcontractor from further subcontracting. For clarity, vendors where commercial building blocks or compounds will be  {E76:function="",head="",partofspeech="" purchased}  are nor  {E77:function="",head="",partofspeech="" regarded}  as subcontractors. 2.6 Target Exclusivity. During the  term  of this Agreement, except in the {E199:function="",head="",partofspeech="" performance} of its obligations or {E200:function="",head="",partofspeech="" exercise} of its rights under this Agreement, neither OntoChem nor any of its Affiliates will  {E78:function="",head="",partofspeech="" discover}  ,  {E79:function="",head="",partofspeech="" research}  ,  {E80:function="",head="",partofspeech="" develop}  ,  {E81:function="",head="",partofspeech="" manufacture}  or  {E82:function="",head="",partofspeech="" commercialize}  any compound or product  {E83:function="",head="",partofspeech="" directed}  to any Target, either independently or for or in collaboration with a third party ( {E84:function="",head="",partofspeech="" including}  the grant of a license to any third party), or have any of the foregoing {E201:function="",head="",partofspeech="" activities}  {E85:function="",head="",partofspeech="" performed}  on behalf of OntoChem or any of its Affiliates by a third party. For clarity, the foregoing  {E86:function="",head="",partofspeech="" includes}  the {E202:function="",head="",partofspeech="" screening} ( {E87:function="",head="",partofspeech="" including}  via computational methods) of any compound library or virtual compound library against any Target. 2.7 Records.
